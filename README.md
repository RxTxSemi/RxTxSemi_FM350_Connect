## 🚀 Quick Start
You don’t need to install Python or dependencies.  
Just download the prebuilt GUI app from the [Releases page](https://github.com/RxTxSemi/RxTxSemi_FM350Linux/releases), make it executable, and run:

```bash
wget https://github.com/RxTxSemi/RxTxSemi_FM350Linux/releases/latest/download/rxtxsemi-fm350
chmod +x rxtxsemi-fm350
./rxtxsemi-fm350
```

## 🔑 Grant Modem Access
Modem serial ports (`/dev/ttyUSB*`) are owned by the **dialout** group.  
Add your user to the group:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
newgrp dialout
```

You may need to **log out and log back in** for changes to take effect.

## ⚙️ Configure udev Rules

In some cases, **ModemManager may interfere** with the FM350-GL modem.  
You can add a udev rule to prevent ModemManager from claiming the device.

### Step 1: Create the rule file
Open a new udev rules file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-fm350.rules
```

### Step 2: Add the rule
Paste the following line inside the file:

```text
ATTRS{idVendor}=="0e8d", ATTRS{idProduct}=="7127", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"
```

### Step 3: Reload and apply rules
Run the following commands:

```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

### Step 4: Restart ModemManager
```bash
sudo systemctl restart ModemManager
```
